# vim-config

This is my .vimrc, which you're free to use however you see fit. It works for me  
but it may not work for you, and that's fine. My primary use cases, if not evident  
from the selected plugins, revolve around Bash/Python/Rust with a need for Git
integration.

There are not a plethora of keybindings assigned, because I'm rather comfortable with  
typing, or just using tab-completion. As time goes on, I'm sure I'll add some more  
custom mappings to take care of frequently tab-completed tasks.
